# 3D Printing System:

## Rules 

The lab will not 3D print the following (alt: The lab will print everything except): 

	Prints over 1000g  
	
	Print time over 24 hours 
	
	Open polysurfaces / meshes 
	
	Non-manifold polysurfaces 
	
	Objects with geometry smaller than 1mm (1/16 in) 
	
	Simple geometry that can be easily built using alternative material / method 

If you have any questions about your file, come into the lab before submitting it 

## Pre-submission Checklist

1. Rebuild your Geometery following our [best practice guide](Tutorials&Templates/3DPrinters.md)

2. Check time/material use in Cura and Understand your Desired output
	(See below if you have not done this before!)
	
3. Submit your Job to the Queue
	(Write Up Incoming)


## File Submission / Appointment Sign-Up 

Submit your 3D model / sign up for an appointment (add in pop-up agreement that youâ€™ve checked your geometry to confirm it follows rules above and to not bully student workers/staff) 


## How to Check a file in Cura:

The Goal of this is to let you investigate the time and results of your printing job before you come into the lab.

1. Download the correct version of Ultimaker Cura listed below. We recommend uninstalling other versions so as not to cause any confusion.

	Current Version Lab is using: 5.7.2

[Windows](https://github.com/Ultimaker/Cura/releases/download/5.7.2-RC2/UltiMaker-Cura-5.7.2-win64-X64.exe)

[Link to other downloads](https://github.com/Ultimaker/Cura/releases/tag/5.7.2-RC2)

2. Import the profile of the Utlimaker S5:
	Select the printer tab: IMG
	Select Add New: IMG
	Select Non Networked Printer: IMG
	Select the Ultimaker S5
	Select the Generic PLA: IMG
	Disable the Second Head: IMG


2. Import the most up to date settings profile provided by NYIT Fab Lab.

	Current file: [NYIT_Prototype.curaprofile](resources/3Dprinters/NYIT_Prototype.curaprofile)
	
	
	
3. Bring your .STL File you exported from RHINOCEROS into Ultimaker Cura
