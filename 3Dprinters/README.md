# 3D Printing

**The SoAD Fab Lab is *changing* 3D printing starting Fall 2025.**  

**To use the lab's *Ultimaker 3D Printers,* students must first submit the file to the 3D Printing Queue, then *go into the lab in person* to have a student worker check and process the file.**  

**Files will NOT be run in the order they appear on the queue, but instead on a first come, first served basis. (similar to plotting)**

Reminders:
* Anything can be 3D modeled, but not everything can be 3D printed. *It is the responsibility of the student to design their 3D model to be 3D printed.*

* All students must review and submit files according to the SoAD Fab Lab 3D Printing Process / Standards


## 3D Printing Process / Standards

The lab will print any file submitted to the 3D Printing Job Queue that follows the lab's process and standards.  Any submitted files that do not comply with the following process and standards will be rejected. 


### Required Orientation / Training
* Students must complete the SoAD Fab Lab Canvas Orientation before visting the lab space this semester.
  
* Students *without* a SoAD Lab Sticker must come into the lab to sign a waiver before gaining access to any NYIT SoAD Labs.

  
 ### 3D Model Requirements

*Geometry must be:*
 
* Closed polysurface / mesh
  
* Not non-manifold

* Flat bottom objects aligned / oriented to the CPlane 
  
* Larger than 1 mm (1/16 in)
  
* Complex geometry that cannot be easily built using alternative material / method 

Use this [3D Modeling for 3D Printing Guide](https://digitalfabricationlab-nyit-soad.github.io/resources/Tutorials&Templates/3Dprinters/ModelingGuide/) as a reference

   
### Material Use / Print Time
 
*3D Prints must be:*

* Under 1000g of print material
  
* Under 24hr total print time

Use this  [Cura Slicing Guide](https://digitalfabricationlab-nyit-soad.github.io/resources/Tutorials&Templates/3Dprinters/CuraSlicer/) to check your material use / print time


### File Submission

*Files submissions must be:*

* Rhino 7 (.3dm) file
  
* Units in millimeters
  
* 1 file = 1 printer - all geometry must be nested into a single build volume: 310 x 220 x 280mm / 12 x 9 x 11in 
  
* Only 2 files per student allowed in the queue at a time. Students must wait for a file to be completed or rejected to submit another.
	* Any extra files in the queue will be rejected

Submit your file to the 3D Printing Job Queue on the 
([Appointments and Job Submissions](https://digitalfabricationlab-nyit-soad.github.io/resources/Tutorials&Templates/SubmissionGuide/)) page


### Timeline

* Allow 3-5 days from start to finish; 5-7 days during busy periods. This includes time spent working with a student worker to check the file before it goes on the machine, time for making changes to any errors, and actual time spent printing 

* To get a print started (and therefore completed) quickly, students should come into the lab as soon as possible. Prints will be run on a first come, first served basis. 

* Expect there to be a wait list to start prints during busy times (midterms and finals)   

* Students will be notified when their 3D print is finished and ready for pick-up. 

* Additional note: The lab will start running files at 10:30 am and no prints will be started after 4:30 pm daily 


### Payment

* Students will be charged $0.08 per gram of the 3D print before the print is started.
  * 3D prints will not be started on a printer until payment is made.

 
### Print Failures

3D printing is a fail-prone process. Prints fail regularly due to *machine* and *design* error. 

* 3D prints that fail due to *machine errors* will be reprinted with no charge to the student.
  
* 3D prints that fail due to *design errors* will not be reprinted and the student will not be refunded for the material used. Students who want to reprint failed files must make necessary edits to the 3D model and resubmit to the Job Queue.


## Resin Printing
Students interested in using the lab's Resin Printers must bring their digital file to the lab to discuss with staff.
* Print cost: $0.30 per milliliter
* Build volume: 130 mm x 130 mm x 180 mm tall (5" x 5" x 7" tall)
