## 3D Printing System:

# Pre-submission 

Check your geometry in Rhino 

Check time/material use in Cura 

Templates / Tutorials / More Info  


# Rules 

## The lab will not 3D print the following (alt: The lab will print everything except): 

	Prints over 1000g  

	Print time over 24 hours 

	Open polysurfaces / meshes 

	Non-manifold polysurfaces 

	Objects with geometry smaller than 1mm (1/16 in) 

	Simple geometry that can be easily built using alternative material / method 

	If you have any questions about your file, come into the lab before submitting it 

## File Submission / Appointment Sign-Up 

Submit your 3D model / sign up for an appointment (add in pop-up agreement that you’ve checked your geometry to confirm it follows rules above and to not bully student workers/staff)
