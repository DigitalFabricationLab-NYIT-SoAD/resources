# 3D Printing

**Students can use the SoAD Fab Lab's *Ultimaker 3D Printers* by submitting a 3D model to the 3D Printing Job Queue.**

Reminders:
* Anything can be 3D modeled, but not everything can be 3D printed. *It is the responsibility of the student to design their 3D model to be 3D printed.*

* All students must review and submit files according to the SoAD Fab Lab 3D Printing Process / Standards


## 3D Printing Process / Standards

The lab will print any file submitted to the 3D Printing Job Queue that follows the lab's process and standards.  Any submitted files that do not comply with the following process and standards will be rejected. 


### Required Orientation / Training
* Students must complete the online SoAD Fab Lab Orientation (link) before using the lab space.

### Timeline
* Allow 3-5 days for your submission to be processed and printed; 5-7 days during busy periods.
  
* Students will be notified when their 3D print is finished and ready for pick-up.

### Payment

* Students will be charged $0.07 per gram of the 3D print before the print is started.
  * 3D prints will not be started on a printer until payment is made.
 
### Print Failures

3D printing is a fail-prone process. Prints fail regularly due to *machine* and *design* error. 

* 3D prints that fail due to *machine errors* will be reprinted with no charge to the student.
  
* 3D prints that fail due to *design errors* will not be reprinted and the student will not be refunded for the material used. Students who want to reprint failed files must make necessary edits to the 3D model and resubmit to the Job Queue.

  
 ### 3D Model Requirements

*Geometry must be:*
 
* Closed polysurface / mesh
  
* Not non-manifold
  
* Larger than 1 mm (1/16 in)
  
* Complex geometry that cannot be easily built using alternative material / method

### Material Use / Print Time
 
*3D Prints must be:*

* Under 1000g of print material
  
* Under 24hr total print time

Use this  [Cura Slicing Guide](https://digitalfabricationlab-nyit-soad.github.io/resources/Tutorials&Templates/3Dprinters/CuraSlicer/) to check your material use / print time


### File Submission

*Files submissions must be:*

* Rhino 7 (.3dm) file
  
* Units in millimeters
  
* 1 file = 1 printer - all geometry must be nested into a single build volume: 310 x 220 x 280mm / 12 x 9 x 11in 
  
* Only 2 files per student allowed in the queue at a time. Students must wait for a file to be completed or rejected to submit another.
	* Any extra files in the queue will be rejected

Submit your file to the 3D Printing Job Queue on the 
([Appointments and Job Submissions](https://digitalfabricationlab-nyit-soad.github.io/resources/Tutorials&Templates/SubmissionGuide/)) page
