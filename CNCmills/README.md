# CNC Machining

**Students can use the SoAD Fab Lab's *TechnoCNC 3-axis Router (47" x 47")* to generate complex geometry from a range of materials (foams, plastics, and wood) within a subtractive manufacturing framework.** 

For information about how to use the *Carvey Mini CNC Router (12" x 8")*, click [here](https://digitalfabricationlab-nyit-soad.github.io/resources/CarveyMiniCNC/). 


Reminders: 

* *CNC machining is a complex fabrication process, we recommend starting early!* As a rule of thumb, allow 1-2 weeks to complete the entire process (model design/edits for CNC, CAM programming, material prep/acquisition, and cut time). 


* At the SoAD FabLab, CNC Machining is a 2-step process consisting of a CAM Appointment and a Cut Appointment. **The Lab does not do same-day cuts.** 
 
 

## CNC Machining Process / Standards 

Any students interested in CNC Machining must read and follow the standards below. 


### Required Orientation / Training 

* Students must have a SoAD Lab Sticker on their ID to book appointments and run CNC jobs. If you do not have this sticker, come into the lab to complete our quiz and sign our waiver.  


* Students must attend a CNC workshop OR review the [CNC User Guide](https://digitalfabricationlab-nyit-soad.github.io/resources/UserGuides/CNCmills) before attending their first CAM appointment.  


### Step 1: CAM Appointments  


***File Requirements***

It is the responsibility of the student to bring a digital model to their CAM Appointment that complies with the following rules:

* Cut geometry situated within the bounding box in the Techno CNC template (47" x 47" x 3 1/2")
  
* Rhino 7 (.3dm) file
  
* On a flash drive (USB)
  
* 10,000 KB (10 MB) maximum file size, purged, save small, save geometry only

*Any geometry that is not ready for CAM programming will be rejected and the student will have to reschedule the appointment before they are able to cut.* 

Use the CNC Template File on the [Templates and Tutorials](https://digitalfabricationlab-nyit-soad.github.io/resources/Tutorials&Templates/) page to set up your 3D Model


***Approved Materials***

Students are responsible for providing their own stock material for cutting. Work with the CNC technician and/or staff to determine the best type of stock material for your geometry/applications. 

*Approved materials for CNC cutting include:*

* Wood
   * Hardwood (*not* dimensional lumber like 2x4's, 4x4's, etc.)
   * Plywood (comes in various grades, consult with CNC Technician *before* purchasing)
* Foam
   * Extruded polystyrene (XPS) (purple/pink insulation foam) (Available for purchase at Home Depot, Lowe's, etc.) 
   * HDU (High Density Urethane) (Available for purchase at The Compleat Sculptor on 6th Ave and 19th Street) 
      * Low Density - pink / salmon
      * Mid Density - beige
      * High Density - pale green
* Plastics
   * Acrylic
   * Many types of plastics that *cannot* be cut on the laser cutter *can* be cut on the CNC

If you are gluing up sheets of material to reach the desired stock thickness, *the glue must be completely dry before your Cut Appointment.*  
 
Come into the lab to ask about our recommended material vendors in the area

### Step 2: CNC Cut Appointments

*Students will schedule their Cut Appointment at the end of their CAM Setup Appointment with the CNC Technician. File cut time will be determined during the CAM Appointment. Cut times can take anywhere from 20 minutes to 4+ hours.*


***Appointment Requirements***

* You must have already completed your CAM appointment with no file issues. You will know this step is completed when your CAM file is saved (by the CNC Technician) on the CNC computer in the shop
  
* Bring in your stock, ready to cut. (NO wet or uncured glue, paint, etc.)
  
* For safety reasons, at least one student must be present in the CNC room to monitor the cut the entire time a job is running.
