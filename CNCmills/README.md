# CNC Milling

**Students can use the CNC machines by signing up for CAM Setup and Cut appointments**

Reminders:
* CNC milling is an involved process - allow 1-2 weeks for any CNC project
* If gluing layered stock material, glue *must be fully dry* before your machine appointment

## CNC Milling Standards

### Required Orientation / Training
* Students must complete the online SoAD Fab Lab Orientation (LINK) before using the lab space
* Students must sign-up for an in-person CAM Setup Appointment to be able to sign-up for a Cut Appointment
* The lab recommends all students to read the CNC Intro Guide (LINK) before their first CNC Appointments

### CAM Setup Appointments
* Students will work with a CNC Technician to  Appointment
* Consultation appointments are set for 30 minutes, but might be shorter / longer depending on the file 
* Students are required to bring their 3D Model file on a USB to their CNC Consultation Appointment
* Students will need to know what stock material they wish to use (it is recommended to buy your stock material *after* your CAM Setup Appointment)

***File Requirements***

*3D Model must be:*
1. In a Rhino 7 file (max 150kb)
2. Only the geometry that you wish to cut on the CNC
3. Modeled at full scale (actual size you want the object to be when it comes off the mill)
4. Fit into the machine maximum dimensions and maximum tool lengths: Techno CNC (48 x 48 x 4 in) and Carvey (12 x 8 x 2 in)

Use the CNC Template File (LINK) to set up your 3D Model

***Stock Material***

*Accepted CNC stock material:*
* Wood
   * Hardwood (*not* dimensional lumber like 2x4's, 4x4's, etc.)
   * Plywood (comes in various grades, consult with CNC Technician *before* purchasing)
* Foam
   * Extruded polystyrene (aka purple or pink foam, often used as insulation panels)
   * HDU (High Density Urethane)
      * Low Density - pink / salmon
      * Mid Density - beige
      * High Density - pale green
* Plastics
   * Acrylic
   * Many types of plastics that *cannot* be cut on the laser cutter *can* be cut on the CNC
 
  Use the Vendor List (LINK) to see stock material sellers in the area

### Machining Appointments
* Students will schedule their Machining Appointment at the end of their CAM Setup Appointment with the CNC Technician
