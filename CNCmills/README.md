#CNC Milling

**Students can use the CNC machines by signing up for CAM Setup and Cut appointments**

Reminders:
* CNC milling is an involved process - allow 1-2 weeks for any CNC project
* If gluing layered stock material, glue *must be fully dry* before your machine appointment

## CNC Milling Standards

### Required Orientation / Training
* Students must complete the online SoAD Fab Lab Orientation (LINK) before using the lab space
* Students must sign-up for an in-person CAM Setup Appointment to be able to sign-up for a Cut Appointment
* The lab recommends all students to read the CNC Intro Guide (LINK) before their first CNC Appointments

### CAM Setup Appointments
* Students will work with a CNC Technician to  Appointment
* Consultation appointments are set for 30 minutes, but might be shorter / longer depending on the file 
* Students are required to bring their 3D Model file on a USB to their CNC Consultation Appointment
* Students will need to know what stock material they wish to use (it is recommended to buy your stock material *after* your CAM Setup Appointment)

***File Requirements***

*3D Model must be:*
- [x] In a Rhino 7 file (max 150kb)
- [x] Only the geometry that you wish to cut on the CNC
- [x] Modeled at full scale (actual size you want the object to be when it comes off the mill)
- [x] Fit into the machine maximum dimensions and maximum tool lengths: Techno CNC (48 x 48 x 4 in) and Carvey (12 x 8 x 2 in)

Use the CNC Template File (LINK) to set up your 3D Model

***Stock Material***

*Accepted CNC stock material:*
* Wood
   * Hardwood (*not* dimensional lumber like 2x4's, 4x4's, etc.)
   * Plywood (comes in various grades, consult with CNC Technician *before* purchasing)
* Foam
   * Extruded polystyrene (aka purple or pink foam, often used as insulation panels)
   * HDU (High Density Urethane)
      * Low Density - pink / salmon
      * Mid Density - beige
      * High Density - pale green
* Plastics
   * Acrylic
   * Many types of plastics that *cannot* be cut on the laser cutter *can* be cut on the CNC
 
  Use the Vendor List (LINK) to see stock material sellers in the area
