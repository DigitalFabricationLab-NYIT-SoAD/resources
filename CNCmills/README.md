# CNC Machining

**Students can use the SoAD Fab Lab's *TechnoCNC Router (48" x 48")* by attending a CAM Appointment followed by a CNC Cut Appointment. For information about how to use the *Carvey Mini CNC Router (12" x 8")*, click [here](https://digitalfabricationlab-nyit-soad.github.io/resources/CarveyMiniCNC/)**.

Reminders:
* *CNC machining is a complex fabrication process, we recommend starting early!* As a rule of thumb, allow 1-2 weeks to complete the entire process (model design/edits for CNC, CAM programming, material prep/acquisition, and cut time).

* Digital 3D models are built from essentially nothing in empty space. The approach of CNC machining is the opposite; it is a process of subtractive manufacturing, where a tool carves into a stock material to leave behind the desired object. 


## CNC Machining Process / Standards
Any students interested in CNC Machining must read and follow the standards below.


### Required Orientation / Training
* Students must complete the SoAD Fab Lab Canvas Orientation visting the lab space this semester.
  
* Students *without* a SoAD Lab Sticker must come into the lab to sign a waiver before gaining access to any NYIT SoAD Labs.
   
* Students must review the [CNC User Guide](https://digitalfabricationlab-nyit-soad.github.io/resources/UserGuides/CNCmills) before attending their first CAM appointment.
    
* If you have never used a CNC router before, we recommend you come into the lab for a quick consultation before signing up for a CNC appointment. Bring your model pulled up on your laptop and we can talk about the best approach for what you are trying to make.


### Timeline
* If a student is interested in CNC machining their model, we recommend starting the consultation / preparation process **1-2 weeks** before you want to be finished with the cut.
  
* File setup and material retrieval take the most time; this is the responsibility of the student. The more prepared a student is for their CAM Appointment, the quicker the entire CNC process will be. 


### Step 1: CAM Appointments 
*File setup and material retrieval take the most time in CNC Machining; this is the responsibility of the student.* To make the best use of the labâ€™s time (and yours), schedule your CAM appointment when you have a pretty solid idea of what you want to cut and how you want to go about it. 


***File Requirements***

It is the responsibility of the student to bring a digital model to their CAM Appointment that complies with the following rules:

* Cut geometry situated within the bounding box in the Techno CNC template (48 x 48 in)
  
* Rhino 7 (.3dm) file
  
* On a flash drive (USB)
  
* 150 KB maximum file size

*Any geometry that is not ready for CAM programming will be rejected and the student will have to reschedule the appointment before they are able to cut.* 

Use the CNC Template File on the [Templates and Tutorials](https://digitalfabricationlab-nyit-soad.github.io/resources/Tutorials&Templates/) page to set up your 3D Model


***Approved Materials***

Students are responsible for providing their own stock material for cutting. Work with the CNC technician and/or staff to determine the best type of stock material for your geometry/applications. 

*Approved materials for CNC cutting include:*

* Wood
   * Hardwood (*not* dimensional lumber like 2x4's, 4x4's, etc.)
   * Plywood (comes in various grades, consult with CNC Technician *before* purchasing)
* Foam
   * Extruded polystyrene (XPS) (purple/pink insulation foam)
   * HDU (High Density Urethane)
      * Low Density - pink / salmon
      * Mid Density - beige
      * High Density - pale green
* Plastics
   * Acrylic
   * Many types of plastics that *cannot* be cut on the laser cutter *can* be cut on the CNC

If you are gluing up sheets of material to reach the desired stock thickness, *the glue must be completely dry before your Cut Appointment.* We recommend following these stock glue-up guidelines/tips. 
 
Come into the lab to ask about our recommended material vendors in the area

***Book a CAM Appointment via [EZBook](new.ezbook.com/NYIT) or visit the Fab Lab on your campus first to review your CNC file with a staff member***


### Step 2: CNC Cut Appointments

*Students will schedule their Machining Appointment at the end of their CAM Setup Appointment with the CNC Technician. File cut time will be determined during the CAM Appointment. Cut times can take anywhere from 20 minutes to 4+ hours.*


***Appointment Requirements***

* You must have already completed your CAM appointment with no file issues. You will know this step is completed when your CAM file is saved (by the CNC Technician) on the CNC computer in the shop
  
* Bring in your stock, ready to cut. (NO wet or uncured glue, paint, etc.)
  
* For safety reasons, at least one student must be present in the CNC room to monitor the cut the entire time a job is running.

***Cut Appointments will be scheduled with Fab Lab Staff during CAM Appointments***
