# Carvey â€“ Mini CNC Router 

**The SoAD Fab Lab's *Carvey CNC Router (12" x 8")* is available for student use on a walk-in, self-serve basis.** 

Reminders: 

* Students are responsible for all file setup and machine operation. Students should check in with a staff member or qualified student worker when using the machine for the first time in order to verify programmed files and obtain in-person training. 

* Students will run [gSender](https://sienci.com/gsender/?srsltid=AfmBOorix9vvRB6lHw--0FJkMFbHveEQ-IJ-zYPYso9l_wRc6BgCQQ-j) from their personal, USB-compatible laptop in order to run the machine. If your laptop has only USB-c connections, you will need to bring your own USB to USB-c adapter to make this connection. 

* Though not required, students have the option of using the school license of RhinoCAM to program files. This is available by making a CAM Appointment via [EZBook.](https://new.ezbook.com/NYIT)   


## General Overview and Safety 


* Foam is the only material that can be processed on this machine at this time. (XPS aka pink/purple foam and HDU) 

* Students should always have their programmed file verified by a staff member or qualified student worker before cutting.  

* In-person training for first timers will cover safe operation of the machine, including jogging, loading materials, changing tools, setting home, and running files. 

* For safety reasons, students must attend the machine at all times while it is running. 

* Students are responsible for all clean-up after use. 

* The FabLab is not responsible for lost files on publicly-used computers. If you are using our computer to setup your CAM files, always save a backup!


*When you have finished your digital model and are ready to program and cut, please follow this two-part step-by-step set of instructions...*
