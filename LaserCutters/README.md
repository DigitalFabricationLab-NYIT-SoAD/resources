## SoAD Fab Lab Laser Cutting Process / Standards


### Required Orientation / Training
* Students must complete the SoAD Fab Lab Canvas Orientation before visiting the lab space this semester.
  
* Students *without* a SoAD Lab Sticker must come into the lab to sign a waiver before gaining access to any NYIT SoAD Labs.
   
* Students must complete the Laser Cutting Training. This can be done in a _group training_ pre-organized by a faculty member or in an _individual training_ during a student's first appointment.

### Laser Cutting Appointments

**General Information**

* One appointment reserves one laser cutter for 25 minutes
  
* If a student is signing up for their first Laser Cutting Appointment, they will be required to dedicate 15-20 minutes of their appointment to training with a Student Worker
      
* Students are responsible for bringing their prepped Rhino file on a USB and material cut-to-size to their laser cutting appointment.
  
  * The more a student prepares before their appointment, the more time can be spent laser cutting during their appointment.
  
* Students are required to be finished cutting and cleaning up by the end of their appointment time.
* Students may purchase a maximum of 10 sheets of material a day for their cut appointment(s). *For topography models that require many sheets of material, please purchase from elsewhere (Blick), then cut it down to size yourself using our large sheet material cutters outside the lab.*
