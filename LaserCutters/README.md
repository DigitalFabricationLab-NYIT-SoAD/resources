## SoAD Fab Lab Laser Cutting Process / Standards


### Required Orientation / Training
* Students must complete the SoAD Fab Lab Orientation before using the lab space for the first time. This can be done online [here](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=cxNWGqGj7UunwoFBBJGiFNb937yciTdPowD-pQyEMWRUOTBEODNTN0EwT1AyMldQU0pVOTNJQVBLUS4u&origin=Invitation&channel=0) or in person on a walk-in basis
   
* Students must complete the Laser Cutting Training. This can be done in a _group training_ pre-organized by a faculty member or in an _individual training_ during a student's first appointment

### Laser Cutting Appointments 
Students are required to be finished cutting and cleaning up by the end of their appointment time. The more a student prepares before their appointment, the more time can be spent laser cutting during their appointment. We recommend all students to use the Laser Cutting File Set-Up Guide (LINK) when prepping for laser appointments.
