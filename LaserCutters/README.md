# Laser Cutting

**The SoAD Fab Lab is *changing* Laser Cutting for students in Fall 2024. Students will now be able to laser cut by signing up for a laser cutting appointment.**

Reminders:
* Laser Cutting Training is required for _all students_ who plan on laser cutting during the Fall 2024 semester

* Laser cutting cardboard is now *banned* in the SoAD Fab Lab


## SoAD Fab Lab Laser Cutting Process / Standards


### Required Orientation / Training
* Students must complete the SoAD Fab Lab Orientation before using the lab space for the first time. This can be done online online or in person on a walk-in basis
   
* Students must complete the Laser Cutting Training. This can be done in a _group training_ pre-organized by a faculty member or in an _individual training_ during a student's first appointment

### Laser Cutting Appointments 
Students are required to be finished cutting and cleaning up by the end of their appointment time. The more a student prepares before their appointment, the more time can be spent laser cutting during their appointment. 

_We recommend all students to use the laser Cutting Template on the [Templates / Tutorials Page](https://digitalfabricationlab-nyit-soad.github.io/resources/Tutorials&Templates/) when prepping for laser appointments._
