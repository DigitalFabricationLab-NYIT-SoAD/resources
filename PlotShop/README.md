# Welcome to the NYIT SoAD Plot Shop Resource page!
  
There have been some changes to how the plot shop is run and managed and we appreciate your patience. We are now have *open hours* where you can come in and run your print. 

**Students must FIRST submit files to the queue, THEN visit the plot shop in-person during open hours to get their files printed.**

Here is a link to the queue: [https://www.nyit.edu/its/plotting_service](https://www.nyit.edu/its/plotting_service)

Please make sure you have enough funds in your account prior to printing.
