# Welcome to the NYIT SoAD Plot Shop Resource page!
  
There have been some changes to how the plot shop is run and managed and we appreciate your patience. We are now have *open hours* where you can come in and run your print. 

**Students must FIRST submit files to the queue, THEN visit the Plot Shop/FabLab in-person during open hours to get their files printed.**

[Here](https://www.nyit.edu/its/plotting_service) is a link to the queue. 

Please make sure you have enough funds in your account prior to printing. All students, faculty, and staff must pay for plotting services. 

Faculty & Staff should **not** use PCards to pay for plot shop services. 

Pricing:

    36" x 24" : $7.00
    36" x 48" : $14.00
    36" x 60" : $17.50
    36" x 72" : $21.00


Plot Shop hours are the same as the FabLab hours for each location. *Check in with FabLab staff first to get access to the plot shop.*
