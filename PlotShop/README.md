# Welcome to the NYIT SoAD Plot Shop Resource page!
  
There have been some changes to how the plot shop is run and managed and we appreciate your patience. We are now have *open hours* where you can come in and run your print. 

## Submitting files to the "Queue" will not result in printed files. 

We will still use the submitted file during your visit to charge you for your print and as a great way to transfer your file from your computer to the lab.

Here is a link to the queue: [https://www.nyit.edu/its/plotting_service](https://www.nyit.edu/its/plotting_service)

Our hours are evolving over the next few weeks but please refer back to this page:
