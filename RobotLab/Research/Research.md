# Slider Driven Auger

As the lab builds out it's Clay 3D printing work, it became necessary to prototpye a driver controll system.

This project uses a few distinct components to control a auger that can be mounted on a robot.

Basic Components:

1. Prusa Extrauder with exposed control and fan plug
2. Polulu Tic Microcontroller 36v4
4. Two Sets of Jumper Wires
5. Potentiometer Slider
6. Power Supply with Barrell Jack adapter

## Basic Set up
