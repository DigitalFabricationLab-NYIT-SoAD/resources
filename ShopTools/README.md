#ShopTools Tool Guide

All SoAD Students may use the shop after they have attended an orientation.

These can be scheduled by your professor in your first year #OR if you missed it, you can attend one of make up sessions.

At the end of your orientation, you will receive a sticker which allows you to use the shop under supervision by shop staff. 

You are expected to follow the below rules at all times, even after your orientation or you become comfortable with the tools.
