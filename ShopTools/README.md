Reminders:

## Shop Rules

**1. SAFETY**


* Dress Code:
	
	Closed toed shoes 
	
	No loose clothing, hair, (we have hair ties) jewelry 
	
	No headphones 
	
	Safety glasses must be worn 

* Additional PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) will be required for job-specific tasks 
	
	Gloves 
	
	Masks 
	
	Hearing protection 

* Use your senses! 

	Touch/feel - is the material resisting going through the blade? Could be a sign something is wrong with your cut. Turn off the machine and assess. 

	Hearing – is it making a strange sound? Could be a sign that something is off. Turn off the machine and assess. 

	Smell – does it smell weird? Does it smell like it is burning? When did you notice this smell? When you turned the machine on or when you started to cut? All of this info is useful to us so we can help you troubleshoot and come up with a safe way to do what you want to do 

	Vision – often, you won't be able to see much of what is going on when you're cutting/feeding material through a blade. It's tempting to keep your eyes locked on the blade/cutting tool as you're cutting, but using your vision to keep track of your fingers is often a better use of that sense. Use your vision to make sure the part is held tight to the fence/guide and to keep your fingers clear of the cutter at all times.  

**2. CLEAN UP after yourself**

* Put tools you've used away. If you used a tool that someone else left out, but it back where it belongs, not just where you found it lying around. If you see tools left out and you know where it goes, help us out, put it away. 

Sweep! 

* Clean up and report any spills 

* A job is not complete until your work area is clean. 

**3. If in doubt, ASK FOR HELP** 

Staff members and student workers are knowledgeable makers, they may have ideas about ways to do things that can make your cut easier and safer 

Keep in mind: staff members and student workers have the right to reject cuts/operations if they are unsafe. Fear not! If one door closes, another opens. 


**4. RESPECT staff, student workers, space, tools, etc.**

Students in the shop must **respect** all staff, student workers, each other, and the space/machines/tools 

**5. SHARED SPACE**

Put your name / date / contact info on materials. Shop tools don't leave the shop 

## Other Policy 

* Dust collectors should be ON when machines are in use 

* Table saw is staff-only use 

* Staff has the right to reject cuts if they are unsafe 

* Talk to us before you get too deep to make sure what you're attempting is feasible. Even so, staff still has the right to stop work at any time if the making process becomes unsafe
