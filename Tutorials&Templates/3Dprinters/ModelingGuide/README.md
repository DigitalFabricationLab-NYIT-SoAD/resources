# 3D Modeling for 3D Printing

You have found our basic guide on Modeling for 3D printing. 

It is the responsibility of the student to design and submit a printable 3D model. If you have a 3D model made for your design studio, it is very unlikely that it is ready to print.

*Use this guide to review your 3D Print File **before** submitting to the 3D Printing Job Queue.* 

## How to Check Object Properties

Select the Single Mesh / Polysurface you are hoping to 3D print and view the object properties:

Use The Command "ShowEdges" and Click Through the available types of edges:

## Identifying Bad Geometry

Evaluate your object properties according standards set in the lab's 3D Model Requirements. 

The SoAD Fabrication Lab will *not* 3D Print any of the following geometry: 

### Open Polysurface / Mesh

### Non-Manifold

### Components smaller than 1 mm (1/16 in)

## 3D Printable Model

Once your 3D model follows the requirements above, follow the next step to check the Material Use / Print time in Cura.
