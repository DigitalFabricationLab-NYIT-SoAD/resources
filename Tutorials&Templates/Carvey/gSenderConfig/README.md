# gSender Configuration Best Practices

The Lab recommends setting up some basic keyboard shortcuts for ease of use when running Carvey. The most useful shortcuts will be for X, Y, and Z axis jogging. 

To access and edit these shortucts, click the gear icon at the top right corner, then click "Shortcuts" and scroll down until you find the shortcuts you want to change. 
Use the pencil icon to edit and select which keys will control which movements.

(Note: The Z axis shortcuts we have selected are "." and "," because they share the ">" and "<" symbols on the keyboard, making it visually easier navigate the tool up and down from a laptop. 
You are welcome to use whatever settings you like, but make sure to pick something you will remember to avoid plunging the tool into your stock by accident.)
