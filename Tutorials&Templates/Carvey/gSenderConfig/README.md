# gSender Configuration Best Practices

**gSender must be configured in inches** in order to run Carvey. Double check the units by opening the Settings window (upper right corner, gear icon)

The Lab also recommends setting up some basic keyboard shortcuts for ease of use when running Carvey. The most useful shortcuts will be for **X, Y, and Z axis jogging.** 

From Settings, click "Shortcuts" from the list on the left and scroll down until you find the shortcuts you want to change. 
Use the pencil icon to edit and select which keys will control which movements.

(Note: The Z axis shortcuts we have selected are "." and "," because they share the ">" and "<" symbols on the keyboard, making it visually easier navigate the tool up and down from a laptop. 
You are welcome to use whatever settings you like, but make sure to pick something you will remember to avoid plunging the tool into your stock by accident.)
