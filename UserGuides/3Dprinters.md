SHORT WRITE UP OF OPERATION FLOW: 

## Import File  

    Look at the queue and select file (Note: Queue is 1st come 1st serve basis) 

    Check File and make sure that it is a .3dm format  

    Save File into the folder with today’s date (ARCH > Fabrication Lab > 3D Printing Files > 01_ULTIMAKER > MM.DD) if there isn't one, please create a new one with today’s date in the Ultimaker Folder 

    File should be saved in the standard format (Last Name_First Name_FIle Name)  

## Checking Geometry  

    Go the file and open it with Rhino 7  

    Check that whatever is in the file is either a Closed Solid or Closed Mesh  

    If anything is open file will not print, please send File Issue to the student explaining the issue.  

    Check that closed geometry fits within the boundaries of printer (Note: Ultimaker dimensions are X = 12.50” Y = 9.25” Z = 11.50”)  

    If geometry cannot fit within the space send a File Issue to the student explaining the issue.  

    If there are Multiple Pieces use the ALIGN command to make sure they are aligned to the bottom of the template.  

## Export to Cura  

    Once Geometry has been checked convert file to be in Millimeters as that is used in Cura (File > Properties > Units > Model Units > Millimeters) geometry should be scaled according  

    Select what is to be printed and export as an .stl file (File > Export Selected > Format > stereolithography (.stl))    
	
## Open In Cura  

    Open the file using Cura  

    In Cura select in the top right you can select the print settings 

    Choose the Fast print setting with Supports and Adhesion on  

    Proceed to slice the model (Note: on more complicated models it may take some time to slice)  

    Once the model is sliced check the time that the print will take and the amount of material that will be used  

    Charge the student based on the amount of material that Cura says it will use (Note: as of Spring 24 PLA is .05 cents per gram)   

    If there are insufficient funds in the student's account, they will receive a notification to add the required funds, check back after a couple of minutes and see if they have added funds 

## Setting up Printer 

    Take a USB thumb drive and save the file from Cura (Note: Cura should automatically detect drive and give you the option to save to it) 

    Using the number of grams that the print will use check the back of the 3D printer to see if there will be enough material to complete the print (Note: 1 spool is 1 kg or 1000 grams)  

    If you are unsure remove the spool and weigh it on the scale making sure to subtract the weight of the spool  

    If the 3D print is small enough it is good practice to use some of the emptier spools to print it as opposed to the newer ones   

    If there is enough material skip to the following step, if there isn’t enough replace spool on the back of the Ultimaker 

    On the Ultimaker itself go to the middle filament tab 

    Select the material in Extruder 1 and select Unload   

    Proceed to follow the onscreen instructions 

    In the same tab select Load and follow on-screen instructions 

    Insert the USB thumb drive into the Ultimaker and select the job that is to be printed 

    Watch the 3D printer and make sure that the first layer adheres to the 3D Printer Bed 

    If the filament is not sticking to the bed of the printer try applying some glue to the bed
