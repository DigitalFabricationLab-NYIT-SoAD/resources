# Vacuum Forming

**The SoAD Fab Lab's *Formech Vacuum Former (19" x 17")* is available for student use on a walk-in, self-serve basis.**

Reminders:
* In the world of thermoforming, many different types of plastics can be used. The specific machine we have at NYIT is best suited to form 1 mm (or thinner) polystyrene.

* You are welcome to experiment with forming materials other than this, but remember that the success of your output depends on your willingness to repeatedly test and prototype your design.


## Policies, Tips, and Notes on Safety

* The maximum area of the vacuum former is 19" x 17". We also have 11" x 11" and 5" x 5" reducing windows.
  
* Students are responsible for providing their own material to form.
   
* Molds should be made of solid, strong materials that won't get crushed during the thermoforming process. Some great materials for making molds are wood and high density foam (NOT XPS purple/pink foam). Structurally-designed 3D prints can occasionally work, but run the risk of melting when the hot plastic is draped over the form.
  
* Students must attend the vacuum former at all times. Leaving material in the oven area and walking away is a fire hazard!
